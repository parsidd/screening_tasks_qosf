All solutions posted on this repository. All of us are primarily submitting task 4, however, some of us have also attempted Q1 and Q2, for submission individually.

Each corresponding folder has all the necessary plots and results, and also contains a report that elaborates the procedure followed and the results obtained as well. Codes for task 1 and 2 have also been developed, although there is no report for these, just short description in the respective notebooks. These too can be found in the respective folders.
