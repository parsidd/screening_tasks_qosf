# screening_tasks_qosf
Repository for screening task(s) for the QOSF Mentorship program.

The main task is Task number 4, where we had to determine the minimum eigenvalue of the given operator. The corresponding folder has all the necessary plots and results, and also contains a report that elaborates the procedure followed and the results obtained as well. Codes for task 1 and 2 have also been developed, although there is no report for these. These too can be found in their respective folders.
