All solutions posted on this repository. All of us are primarily submitting task 4, however, we have split both q1 and q4 among ourselves, and present a solutoin to task 1, and two solutions to task 4 in two different approaches and libraries, and an attempt of task 2. To demonstrate a slight variety in all our submissions.

Each corresponding folder has th requisote notebook/plots/code. A detailed report has been attached for 4, in Parth's folder, our primary submission as a team, with a notebook with comments for the other submission, task 1, and a shot at task 2.
