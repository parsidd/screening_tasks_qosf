All solutions posted on this repository. Our primary submission as a team is task 4, however, we have also attempted Q1 and Q2, for submission individually.

The corresponding folder has all the necessary plots and results, and also contains a report that elaborates the procedure followed and the results obtained as well. Codes for task 1 and 2 have also been developed, although there is no report for these, just short description in the respective notebooks. These too can be found in their respective folders.
